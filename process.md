To visualize the process efficiently with a large dataset like yours, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Simplify the Data**
   - **Sample** the data: Randomly select a smaller subset of rows to analyze and visualize.
   - **Aggregate** the data: Group by `msg_key` and count occurrences to see the most common steps.

### 2. **Prepare the Data**
   - Create an edge list from the dataframe to represent transitions between steps.
   - Aggregate the transitions (e.g., `step1 â†’ step2`) to count how often they occur.

### 3. **Use Efficient Libraries**
   - Use tools like `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `NetworkX` for graphs without requiring a GPU.
   - For speed, leverage `Dask` or `Vaex` to handle large dataframes efficiently.

### Example Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example of loading a large DataFrame
# df = pd.read_csv("your_large_file.csv")

# Sampling the data for analysis
sampled_df = df.sample(n=100000)  # Adjust sample size as needed

# Create edges based on sequential steps
sampled_df['next_msg_key'] = sampled_df.groupby('REF')['msg_key'].shift(-1)
edges_df = sampled_df.dropna(subset=['next_msg_key']).groupby(['msg_key', 'next_msg_key']).size().reset_index(name='count')

# Create a directed graph
G = nx.DiGraph()

# Add edges with weights
for _, row in edges_df.iterrows():
    G.add_edge(row['msg_key'], row['next_msg_key'], weight=row['count'])

# Plot the graph
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, k=0.5)  # Adjust layout for better visualization
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, node_size=500)
nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, width=1, alpha=0.7, arrowstyle="->", arrowsize=10)
nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos, font_size=10)
edge_labels = nx.get_edge_attributes(G, 'weight')
nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels(G, pos, edge_labels=edge_labels, font_size=8)

plt.title("Customer Power of Attorney Process")
plt.show()
```

### Optimizations:
1. **Sampling**: Use a representative sample (`df.sample()` or a filtered subset of customers).
2. **Aggregation**: Group similar rows or transitions to reduce the data volume.
3. **Parallel Computing**:
   - Use `Dask` for chunked processing:
     ```python
     import dask.dataframe as dd
     ddf = dd.from_pandas(df, npartitions=10)
     ```
   - Process chunks and aggregate results.


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Group by REF and calculate frequency of msg_key (or other criteria)
stratify_col = df.groupby('REF')['msg_key'].nunique()

# Perform stratified sampling
train_refs, sampled_refs = train_test_split(
    df['REF'].drop_duplicates(),
    test_size=0.01,  # Adjust proportion as needed
    stratify=stratify_col,
    random_state=42
)
sampled_df = df[df['REF'].isin(sampled_refs)]
```
