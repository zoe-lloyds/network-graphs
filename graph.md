To create a network graph of relationships and investigate central nodes, clusters, and outliers in Python, you can use the **NetworkX** library. Here's a step-by-step guide:

---

### 1. **Install Necessary Libraries**
If you haven't already, install `networkx` and `matplotlib`:

```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib
```

---

### 2. **Prepare the Data**
Assume you have a dataset in a DataFrame `df` with columns: `party_id`, `relation_id`, and `relationship_type`.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example data
data = {
    "party_id": [1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5],
    "relation_id": ["A", "A", "B", "C", "C", "D"],
    "relationship_type": ["POA", "POA", "Guardian", "Guardian", "POA", "Guardian"]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

---

### 3. **Create a Network Graph**
Use NetworkX to build the graph where `party_id` and `relation_id` are nodes, and relationships are edges.

```python
import networkx as nx

# Create a graph
G = nx.Graph()

# Add edges (party_id and relation_id as nodes)
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    G.add_edge(row["party_id"], row["relation_id"], relationship_type=row["relationship_type"])
```

---

### 4. **Analyze the Network**
#### a. **Central Nodes**
Find nodes with the highest degree (number of connections):

```python
central_nodes = sorted(G.degree, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:5]  # Top 5 central nodes
print("Central Nodes:", central_nodes)
```

#### b. **Clusters**
Detect tightly connected groups using **community detection algorithms** or connected components:

```python
# Find connected components (clusters)
clusters = list(nx.connected_components(G))
print("Clusters:", clusters)
```

#### c. **Outliers**
Find isolated nodes or nodes with very few connections:

```python
# Identify isolated nodes
isolated_nodes = list(nx.isolates(G))
print("Isolated Nodes:", isolated_nodes)
```

---

### 5. **Visualize the Network**
Use Matplotlib to visualize the graph.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Draw the graph
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
nx.draw(
    G,
    with_labels=True,
    node_color="lightblue",
    edge_color="gray",
    node_size=500,
    font_size=10
)
plt.title("Relationship Network")
plt.show()
```

---

### 6. **Insights**
- **Central Nodes**: Investigate nodes (especially `relation_id`s) with many connections for potential abuse of authority or frequent representatives.
- **Clusters**: Look for patterns in clusters. For example, familial or organizational groups may appear as small, dense clusters.
- **Outliers**: Nodes with few or no connections (e.g., `isolated_nodes`) might indicate errors or one-off relationships needing further scrutiny.

---

### Custom Extensions
- Use edge attributes (e.g., `relationship_type`) for more detailed analysis, like coloring edges by relationship type.
- Incorporate additional attributes (e.g., relationship start dates) to add time-based insights.

Let me know if you'd like help with enhancing this analysis!

Here’s an expanded version of the analysis, including enhanced visualizations and steps to clearly identify and visualize clusters and central nodes in your network graph.

1. Central Node Analysis

We’ll measure degree centrality, which indicates the number of connections each node has, and visualize the most central nodes.

Code for Centrality Analysis:

```python
# Calculate degree centrality
degree_centrality = nx.degree_centrality(G)

# Sort central nodes
sorted_centrality = sorted(degree_centrality.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# Top 5 central nodes
top_central_nodes = sorted_centrality[:5]
print("Top 5 Central Nodes (with Degree Centrality):")
for node, centrality in top_central_nodes:
    print(f"Node: {node}, Centrality: {centrality}")

```
Visualization:

Highlight the top 5 central nodes in the graph.
```python
# Get the top 5 nodes
top_nodes = [node for node, _ in top_central_nodes]

# Set node sizes based on degree centrality
node_sizes = [1000 if node in top_nodes else 300 for node in G.nodes]

# Draw graph with central nodes highlighted
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
nx.draw(
    G,
    with_labels=True,
    node_color=["red" if node in top_nodes else "lightblue" for node in G.nodes],
    edge_color="gray",
    node_size=node_sizes,
    font_size=10,
)
plt.title("Network Graph Highlighting Central Nodes")
plt.show()
```

2. Cluster Analysis

For cluster detection, we use connected components and visualize each cluster with a distinct color.

Code for Clusters:
```python
# Find connected components (clusters)
clusters = list(nx.connected_components(G))

# Assign each node to a cluster
cluster_mapping = {node: i for i, cluster in enumerate(clusters) for node in cluster}

# Get a color for each cluster
cluster_colors = [cluster_mapping[node] for node in G.nodes]

print("Clusters Found:", clusters)
```
Visualization:

Each cluster is colored differently.
```python
# Draw graph with clusters
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
nx.draw(
    G,
    with_labels=True,
    node_color=cluster_colors,
    cmap=plt.cm.Paired,  # Use a colormap for clusters
    edge_color="gray",
    node_size=500,
    font_size=10,
)
plt.title("Network Graph with Clusters Highlighted")
plt.show()
```

3. Outlier Analysis

We’ll visualize isolated nodes (nodes without any connections).

Code for Isolated Nodes:

```python
# Find isolated nodes
isolated_nodes = list(nx.isolates(G))
print("Isolated Nodes:", isolated_nodes)

# Draw graph highlighting isolated nodes
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
nx.draw(
    G,
    with_labels=True,
    node_color=["green" if node in isolated_nodes else "lightblue" for node in G.nodes],
    edge_color="gray",
    node_size=[200 if node in isolated_nodes else 500 for node in G.nodes],
    font_size=10,
)
plt.title("Network Graph Highlighting Isolated Nodes")
plt.show()
```
4. Combine Clusters and Central Nodes

To gain deeper insights, overlay cluster information with centrality (e.g., size of the node).

Code for Combined Visualization:
```python
# Node size based on centrality
centrality_sizes = [500 + degree_centrality[node] * 3000 for node in G.nodes]

# Cluster color mapping
combined_cluster_colors = [cluster_mapping[node] for node in G.nodes]

# Draw graph
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 12))
nx.draw(
    G,
    with_labels=True,
    node_color=combined_cluster_colors,
    cmap=plt.cm.Paired,  # Cluster colors
    edge_color="gray",
    node_size=centrality_sizes,  # Size by centrality
    font_size=10,
)
plt.title("Network Graph: Centrality and Clusters")
plt.show()
```

5. Detailed Insights

a. Central Nodes:

	•	From the central node visualization, you can see the most connected nodes in red. These often signify important relation_ids, such as representatives or frequent connections.

b. Clusters:

	•	Each group of connected nodes is shown in a unique color. Smaller clusters might represent tight family units or specific organizations.

c. Isolated Nodes:

	•	Isolated nodes are highlighted in green. These are party_ids or relation_ids that have no relationships, which could indicate data errors or standalone entities.

6. Export Results

If you’d like to work further with these clusters and centrality metrics, you can export them as follows:

```python
# Export centrality
centrality_df = pd.DataFrame(sorted_centrality, columns=["Node", "Centrality"])
centrality_df.to_csv("centrality.csv", index=False)

# Export clusters
cluster_df = pd.DataFrame([
    {"Node": node, "Cluster": cluster_mapping[node]} for node in G.nodes
])
cluster_df.to_csv("clusters.csv", index=False)
```
