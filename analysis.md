Here’s how you can start analyzing your dataset in Python with `pandas` for some of the analyses outlined above. Below is a step-by-step implementation:

### 1. **Setup and Overview**
First, load the dataset and perform an initial exploration.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
# Assuming your data is in a CSV file called 'poa_data.csv'
df = pd.read_csv('poa_data.csv')

# Overview of the dataset
print(df.info())
print(df.head())

# Check for null values
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

---

### 2. **Relationship Type Analysis**
Analyze the distribution of `IPR_TYP_NR`.

```python
# Count relationships by type
relationship_counts = df['IPR_TYP_NR'].value_counts()
print(relationship_counts)

# Visualize relationship type distribution
relationship_counts.plot(kind='bar', title='Relationship Type Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Relationship Type')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```

---

### 3. **Age Analysis**
#### Age Distribution:
```python
# Plot age distributions
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.histplot(df['PTY_AGE'], bins=20, kde=True, label='PTY_AGE', color='blue')
sns.histplot(df['REL_PTY_AGE'], bins=20, kde=True, label='REL_PTY_AGE', color='orange')
plt.title('Age Distribution of Parties')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

#### Age Gap Analysis:
```python
# Calculate age differences
df['AGE_DIFF'] = df['REL_PTY_AGE'] - df['PTY_AGE']

# Plot age differences
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.histplot(df['AGE_DIFF'], bins=30, kde=True, color='green')
plt.title('Age Difference Between Party and Related Party')
plt.xlabel('Age Difference')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

---

### 4. **Deceased Party Analysis**
#### Count Deceased Parties:
```python
# Count deceased parties
deceased_party_count = df['DSC_DATE'].notnull().sum()
deceased_related_party_count = df['REL_PTY_DSD'].notnull().sum()

print(f"Deceased primary parties: {deceased_party_count}")
print(f"Deceased related parties: {deceased_related_party_count}")
```

#### Active Relationships with Deceased Parties:
```python
# Identify active relationships where parties are deceased
active_with_deceased = df[(df['DSC_DATE'].notnull()) | (df['REL_PTY_DSD'].notnull())]
print(active_with_deceased)
```

---

### 5. **Relationship Duration Analysis**
#### Calculate Durations:
```python
from datetime import datetime

# Convert dates to datetime
df['STR_DT'] = pd.to_datetime(df['STR_DT'], errors='coerce')
df['DSC_DATE'] = pd.to_datetime(df['DSC_DATE'], errors='coerce')

# Calculate relationship durations
current_date = datetime.now()
df['RELATIONSHIP_DURATION'] = (df['DSC_DATE'].fillna(current_date) - df['STR_DT']).dt.days

# Summary statistics of durations
print(df['RELATIONSHIP_DURATION'].describe())

# Visualize relationship durations
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(df['RELATIONSHIP_DURATION'], bins=50, kde=True, color='purple')
plt.title('Distribution of Relationship Durations (in Days)')
plt.xlabel('Duration (Days)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

---

### 6. **Flag Potential Issues**
#### Deceased Party Still Active:
```python
# Relationships with deceased parties marked as active
issues = df[((df['DSC_DATE'].notnull()) | (df['REL_PTY_DSD'].notnull())) & (df['RELATIONSHIP_DURATION'] > 0)]
print(f"Potential issues (deceased parties still active): {issues.shape[0]}")
print(issues.head())
```

---

### 7. **Trends Over Time**
#### Relationships Initiated Over Time:
```python
# Extract year of relationship start
df['START_YEAR'] = df['STR_DT'].dt.year

# Count relationships by year
start_trends = df['START_YEAR'].value_counts().sort_index()

# Plot trends over time
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
start_trends.plot(kind='line', marker='o', title='Trends of Relationship Start Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```

---

Here’s an expanded Python implementation to include the additional analyses you requested:

### **Unusual Age Patterns**
#### Find Age Outliers:
```python
# Define unusual age thresholds
min_age_threshold = 18  # Minimum age (e.g., for legal representation)
max_age_threshold = 120  # Maximum realistic age

# Identify unusual ages for primary and related parties
unusual_age_pty = df[(df['PTY_AGE'] < min_age_threshold) | (df['PTY_AGE'] > max_age_threshold)]
unusual_age_rel_pty = df[(df['REL_PTY_AGE'] < min_age_threshold) | (df['REL_PTY_AGE'] > max_age_threshold)]

print(f"Unusual primary party ages: {unusual_age_pty.shape[0]}")
print(f"Unusual related party ages: {unusual_age_rel_pty.shape[0]}")

# Display some unusual age cases
print(unusual_age_pty.head())
print(unusual_age_rel_pty.head())
```

#### Visualize Unusual Age Patterns:
```python
# Highlight outliers with visualizations
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='variable', y='value', data=pd.melt(df[['PTY_AGE', 'REL_PTY_AGE']]), palette="Set2")
plt.title('Boxplot of Primary and Related Party Ages')
plt.xlabel('Party Type')
plt.ylabel('Age')
plt.show()
```

---

### **Multiple Relationships**
#### Find Parties with Multiple Relationships:
```python
# Count relationships by PTY_ID
pty_relationship_counts = df.groupby('PTY_ID').size().reset_index(name='RELATIONSHIP_COUNT')

# Identify parties with multiple relationships
multiple_relationships = pty_relationship_counts[pty_relationship_counts['RELATIONSHIP_COUNT'] > 1]

print(f"Number of parties with multiple relationships: {multiple_relationships.shape[0]}")
print(multiple_relationships.head())

# Merge back to the original dataframe for context
df_multiple_relationships = df.merge(multiple_relationships, on='PTY_ID', how='inner')
print(df_multiple_relationships.head())
```

---

### **Age Compliance**
#### Validate Legal Age for Attorneys:
```python
# Ensure related party meets legal age for attorneys
min_legal_age = 18  # Legal age for being an attorney

# Identify non-compliant cases
age_compliance_issues = df[df['REL_PTY_AGE'] < min_legal_age]
print(f"Non-compliant attorneys under legal age: {age_compliance_issues.shape[0]}")
print(age_compliance_issues.head())
```

---

### **Deceased Compliance**
#### Check Relationships with Deceased Parties:
```python
# Identify cases where either party is deceased
deceased_compliance_issues = df[(df['DSC_DATE'].notnull()) | (df['REL_PTY_DSD'].notnull())]

# Investigate active relationships with deceased parties
active_deceased_issues = deceased_compliance_issues[deceased_compliance_issues['RELATIONSHIP_DURATION'] > 0]

print(f"Relationships with deceased parties: {deceased_compliance_issues.shape[0]}")
print(f"Active relationships with deceased parties: {active_deceased_issues.shape[0]}")
print(active_deceased_issues.head())
```

---

### Summary Insights
You can summarize all issues for reporting purposes:
```python
# Summary of all compliance issues
summary = {
    "Unusual Primary Party Ages": unusual_age_pty.shape[0],
    "Unusual Related Party Ages": unusual_age_rel_pty.shape[0],
    "Parties with Multiple Relationships": multiple_relationships.shape[0],
    "Non-compliant Attorneys (Under Legal Age)": age_compliance_issues.shape[0],
    "Relationships with Deceased Parties": deceased_compliance_issues.shape[0],
    "Active Relationships with Deceased Parties": active_deceased_issues.shape[0],
}

# Print summary
print(pd.DataFrame(summary.items(), columns=["Issue", "Count"]))
```

---

### **Visualizations for Compliance and Trends**
Use visuals to make your findings clear:
#### Multiple Relationships Distribution:
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(pty_relationship_counts['RELATIONSHIP_COUNT'], bins=20, kde=True, color='skyblue')
plt.title('Distribution of Relationship Counts per Party')
plt.xlabel('Number of Relationships')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

#### Deceased and Active Relationships:
```python
# Visualize relationship statuses for deceased parties
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.countplot(data=active_deceased_issues, x='IPR_TYP_NR', order=active_deceased_issues['IPR_TYP_NR'].value_counts().index, palette='Reds')
plt.title('Active Relationships with Deceased Parties by Type')
plt.xlabel('Relationship Type')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```

---

### Next Steps
These additional analyses will flag potential compliance issues and risk indicators:
- Investigate flagged cases (e.g., deceased and active relationships, underage attorneys).
- Use summaries and visualizations for reporting or further auditing steps.
- Let me know if you want to refine or extend any of these analyses!


```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df is your loaded DataFrame
# Define thresholds for analysis
min_age_threshold = 18  # Minimum legal age
max_age_threshold = 120  # Maximum realistic age

# Calculate age differences
df['AGE_DIFF'] = abs(df['REL_PTY_AGE'] - df['PTY_AGE'])

# 1. Age Flags
# Unusual primary and related party ages
unusual_age_pty = df[(df['PTY_AGE'] < min_age_threshold) | (df['PTY_AGE'] > max_age_threshold)]
unusual_age_rel_pty = df[(df['REL_PTY_AGE'] < min_age_threshold) | (df['REL_PTY_AGE'] > max_age_threshold)]

# Unusual age differences
unusual_age_diff = df[df['AGE_DIFF'] > 50]  # Arbitrary threshold for large age differences

# Minors as related parties or primary parties
minor_related_parties = df[df['REL_PTY_AGE'] < min_age_threshold]
minor_primary_parties = df[df['PTY_AGE'] < min_age_threshold]

# Combine age flags into one CSV
age_flags = pd.concat([
    unusual_age_pty.assign(FLAG="Unusual PTY Age"),
    unusual_age_rel_pty.assign(FLAG="Unusual REL PTY Age"),
    unusual_age_diff.assign(FLAG="Unusual Age Difference"),
    minor_related_parties.assign(FLAG="Minor Related Party"),
    minor_primary_parties.assign(FLAG="Minor Primary Party")
])

age_flags.to_csv('age_flags.csv', index=False)

# 2. Deceased Flags
# Deceased primary parties and related parties
deceased_primary = df[df['DSC_DATE'].notnull()]
deceased_related = df[df['REL_PTY_DSD'].notnull()]

# Save deceased flags
deceased_primary.to_csv('deceased_primary.csv', index=False)
deceased_related.to_csv('deceased_related.csv', index=False)

# 3. Party ID Relationship Counts and Most Common Type
# Relationship counts by PTY_ID
pty_relationship_counts = df.groupby('PTY_ID').agg(
    RELATIONSHIP_COUNT=('IPR_TYP_NR', 'size'),
    MOST_COMMON_RELATIONSHIP=('IPR_TYP_NR', lambda x: x.mode().iloc[0] if not x.mode().empty else None)
).reset_index()

# Save relationship counts
pty_relationship_counts.to_csv('pty_relationship_counts.csv', index=False)

print("CSV files created:")
print("- age_flags.csv")
print("- deceased_primary.csv")
print("- deceased_related.csv")
print("- pty_relationship_counts.csv")
```
